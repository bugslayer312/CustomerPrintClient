# CustomerPrintClient

There are three type of actors: PrintServer, PrintShopClient and CustomerPrintClient.

CustomerPrintClient serves for customers to send print jobs to the PrintServer. PrintServer sends print jobs to particular PrintShopClient where the customer wants to print his documents.

This PrintShopClient allows to choose a document on the disk and a Print Shop on the map and send document for printing to that Print Shop using Print Server.
